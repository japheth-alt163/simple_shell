## Project Overview

This shell project is an implementation of a Unix-like shell in C. It provides a command-line interface to interact with the operating system, execute both built-in and external commands, handle signals, and more. It serves as a fundamental tool for system administration and scripting tasks.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project was to create a lightweight yet functional shell that offers flexibility, ease of use, and the ability to understand and execute a wide range of commands. We aimed to build a shell that would be both educational for aspiring developers and practical for everyday use.

## Prerequisites

To compile and use this shell, you need the following prerequisites:

- A Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, or similar).
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) installed.
- Basic knowledge of using the command line.

## Installation

To compile the shell, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd shell-project
   ```

2. Compile the source files using GCC:

   ```bash
   gcc -o myshell shell_main.c primary_helper_functions.c secondary_helper_functions.c other_helper_functions.c sys_function_handler.c
   ```

## Configuration

The shell can be configured using environment variables and command-line options. Here are some configuration options:

- **Environment Variables**: You can modify the behavior of the shell by setting environment variables. For example, you can set `SHELL_PROMPT` to customize the shell prompt.

- **Command-line Options**: You can pass command-line options to the shell executable. For example, you can use `-v` for verbose mode or `-d` for debugging mode.

## Usage Examples

### Built-in Commands

The shell supports various built-in commands. Here are some examples:

- `env`: Lists the environment variables.
- `exit [status]`: Exits the shell with an optional status code.
- `cd [directory]`: Changes the current directory.
- Add more built-in commands as needed by modifying the `sys_function_handler.c` file.

### External Commands

The shell can execute external commands as well. Simply enter the command you want to run, and the shell will attempt to execute it. If the command is not found in the current directory, the shell will search for it in the directories listed in the `PATH` environment variable.

```bash
ls -l
```

## Error Handling

The shell has robust error handling. It reports errors, including syntax errors, command not found errors, and more. It also returns appropriate exit status codes for use in scripts.

## Testing

The project includes a testing framework. To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

This script will execute various test cases to ensure the correctness of the shell.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Make your changes and test them thoroughly.
4. Commit your changes and push them to your fork.
5. Create a pull request to the original repository.

Please ensure your code follows the project's coding style and conventions.

## API Documentation

This project provides a library or API for others to use. Here's a brief overview of the API:

### `int custom_printf(char *str, int strm)`

Prints a string to the specified stream.

```c
#include "shell.h"

int main() {
    custom_printf("Hello, world!\n", STDOUT_FILENO);
    return 0;
}
```
